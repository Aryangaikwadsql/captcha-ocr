# Why Python (vs JS and C++), briefly:
# - Python: Richest CV/ML ecosystem (OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow, EasyOCR), fastest R&D iteration, abundant tooling/datasets.
# - JavaScript: Great for UI and glue code; training and low-level CV pipelines are less mature and slower to iterate.
# - C++: Best raw performance for production inference (e.g., ONNX/TensorRT), but slower to develop/research; typical flow is prototype/train in Python, export and serve via C++/Rust for high throughput.

# Confidence:
# - Local CRNN: average per-character softmax probabilities after greedy CTC collapse (0â€“1).
# - EasyOCR: returns confidence; we use it directly.
# - Tesseract: no direct confidence on this path, treat as 0.0 or calibrate externally.
# - OpenRouter: ask model to return a confidence; optionally validate against charset/length or cross-check with local OCR.
